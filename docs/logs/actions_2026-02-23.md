## Session Summary

**Session**: Claude Code Skillset + Rules Setup
**Steps completed**: 7
**Files created**:
- `.claude/commands/new-feature.md`
- `.claude/commands/migration.md`
- `.claude/commands/test.md`
- `.claude/commands/build.md`

**Migrations added**: none
**Tests**: not run (infrastructure/config session only)
**Docs**: `docs/README.md` created

## [HH:MM] Fix GitHub Workflow: Docker “no such table: Groups” and certificate error

**Type**: modify
**Files affected**:
- `.gitignore` — commented out `Migrations/` so Persistence migrations are committed and available in CI/Docker
- `API/Program.cs` — in Production, call `UseUrls("http://+:8080")` so Kestrel does not require an HTTPS certificate
- `API/appsettings.Production.json` — added `"Https": null` under `Kestrel:Endpoints` so merged config does not keep base Https endpoint
**Reason**: CI failed with “no such table: Groups” (migrations were gitignored) and “Could not find a part of the path '/path/to/your/certificate.pfx'” (Production was still binding HTTPS).
**Rollback**: Uncomment `Migrations/` in `.gitignore`; revert `API/Program.cs` and `API/appsettings.Production.json` with `git checkout HEAD -- <path>`. Then run `git add -f Persistence/Migrations` and commit if you need to keep migrations tracked.
