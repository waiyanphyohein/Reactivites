# Base URL for the backend API. Optional.
# The app auto-selects by protocol: HTTPS page -> https://localhost:5001, HTTP page -> http://localhost:5000.
# Safari requires same protocol (HTTPS page cannot call HTTP API). With Vite+mkcert use HTTPS API:
#   In client: open https://localhost:3000
#   In API:     dotnet run --launch-profile https  (listens on https://localhost:5001)
# VITE_API_URL=https://localhost:5001
